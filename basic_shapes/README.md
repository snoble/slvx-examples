# Basic Geometric Shapes

Simple examples demonstrating fundamental constraint types. These are learning examples, not visually impressive demonstrations.

## Files

- `triangle.json` - Basic triangle with constraints
- `triangle_one_fixed.json` - Triangle with one fixed point
- `triangle_constraints_only.json` - Triangle defined purely by constraints
- `equilateral_triangle.json` - Triangle with equal side lengths
- `square_pure_constraints.json` - Square defined entirely by constraints
- `square_minimal_constraints.json` - Square with minimal constraint set
- `hexagon_pure_constraints.json` - Regular hexagon using constraints
- `pentagon_star.json` - Five-pointed star pattern

## Purpose

These examples are for:
- Learning basic constraint types
- Understanding minimal constraint sets
- Testing solver behavior
