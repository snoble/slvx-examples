# Gear Mechanism

A dual-gear system with proper tooth positioning and meshing.

## Features
- Two interlocking gears with 8 teeth each
- Perpendicular spokes for structural rigidity  
- Proper tooth spacing and alignment

## Constraints Used
- `fixed` - Gear centers
- `distance` - Tooth positions from centers
- `perpendicular` - Spoke arrangements
- Mathematical tooth positioning

## Note
Currently shows gear structure with spokes. Full tooth profiles would require more complex geometry.
