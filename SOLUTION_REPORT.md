# Deployable Solar Panel Array - Solution Report

## Problem Solved

Successfully designed a deployable solar panel array using incremental constraint-based modeling with slvsx-cli.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Incremental Development
- Started with just 2 fixed base points
- Added components one at a time
- Tested after each addition
- Each step built on the previous success

### 2. Single Control Point
- The entire deployment is controlled by ONE angle constraint
- Changing angle from 10° (folded) to 60° (deployed) animates the entire structure
- All other components automatically adjust due to parallel and equal-length constraints

### 3. Pure Constraint-Based Design
- Used mostly non-numeric constraints (parallel, perpendicular, equal_length)
- Let the solver calculate actual positions
- No manual trigonometry required

## Files Created

1. **step1_base.json** - Fixed mounting points (1000mm apart)
2. **step2_first_arm.json** - First folding arm with 750mm segments
3. **step3_second_arm.json** - Parallel second arm with symmetry
4. **step4_cross_brace.json** - Structural cross-bracing (attempted)
5. **step5_panels.json** - Panel mounting points with parallel rails
6. **step6_actuator.json** - Single control angle (60° deployed)
7. **step7_folded.json** - Same structure at 10° (folded state)

## Mechanism Properties

### Deployed State (60° angle)
- Base width: 1000mm
- Arm segments: 750mm each
- Creates a parallelogram linkage
- Panels mount at regular intervals

### Folded State (10° angle)
- Same constraints, different angle
- Structure automatically folds flat
- All relationships maintained

## Key Constraints Used

### Geometric Relationships
- `parallel` - Arms move in sync
- `equal_length` - Symmetric structure
- `horizontal` - Base stays level

### Single Control
- One `angle` constraint controls entire deployment
- Change from 10° to 60° deploys the array

### Fixed Points
- Only 2 fixed points (base_left, base_right)
- Everything else derives from constraints

## Lessons Learned

1. **Start Minimal** - Two fixed points were enough
2. **Build Incrementally** - Add one constraint at a time
3. **Test Frequently** - Catch problems immediately
4. **Use Relationships** - Let solver do the math
5. **Single Control** - One parameter can control complex motion

## Advantages Demonstrated

1. **No Manual Calculation** - Solver finds all positions
2. **Easy Modification** - Change one angle, everything updates
3. **Guaranteed Consistency** - Constraints ensure valid geometry
4. **Exploration** - Try different angles instantly
5. **Error Detection** - Solver tells you if design is impossible

## Next Steps

To extend this design:
1. Add more panel mounting points
2. Add rotation constraints for sun tracking
3. Add minimum/maximum angle limits
4. Add weight distribution constraints
5. Create animation by varying the control angle

## Conclusion

The incremental constraint-based approach successfully created a complex deployable mechanism without calculating a single coordinate manually. The solver handled all the mathematics, allowing focus on the engineering relationships.
