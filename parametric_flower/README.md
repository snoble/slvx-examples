# Parametric Flower

A geometric flower design with 6 petals arranged symmetrically.

## Features
- 6 diamond-shaped petals
- Inner and outer guide circles
- Connecting lines between petal tips
- Fully parametric design

## Design
- Outer radius: 60mm guide circle
- Inner radius: 15mm center circle
- Each petal formed by 4 points creating diamond shape

## Constraints Used
- `fixed` - Center point
- Geometric positioning for symmetry

This example shows how simple geometric constraints can create organic-looking patterns.
