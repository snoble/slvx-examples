# Four Bar Linkage Mechanism

A classic mechanical linkage demonstrating constraint-based motion.

## Features
- Shows multiple positions of the mechanism in motion
- Includes pivot circles and motion trace path
- Demonstrates parametric constraints for mechanical systems

## Constraints Used
- `fixed` - Ground pivot points
- `distance` - Link lengths
- `horizontal` - Ground alignment

## Parameters
- `crank_length`: 30mm
- `coupler_length`: 70mm
- `rocker_length`: 60mm
- `ground_length`: 100mm
