# Future Example Specifications

These directories contain specifications for examples that haven't been implemented yet. They demonstrate good ideas for constraint solver examples but need visual implementation following the [Visual Design Guide](../VISUAL_DESIGN_GUIDE.md).

## Specifications

### Floor Plan Layout
Adaptive apartment layout that adjusts to room dimensions while maintaining building codes and clearances.

### Mechanical Clock
Escapement mechanism with precise gear ratios and pendulum timing.

### PCB Layout
Circuit board component placement with electrical and thermal constraints.

## Implementation Guidelines

If you want to implement one of these:

1. **Read the Visual Design Guide first**
2. Start with simple visual components
3. Test SVG output at every step
4. Ensure components are recognizable
5. Use reasonable coordinate systems
6. Make it visually impressive

Remember: The goal is to create examples that make people say "wow, how did AI calculate that?"
