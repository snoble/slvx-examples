# Constraint Showcase

Demonstrates all 13 available constraint types in SLVSX.

## Constraints Demonstrated

### Rarely Used Constraints
- `point_on_line` - Slider constrained to guide line
- `point_on_circle` - Orbiter constrained to circular path  
- `tangent` - Line tangent to circle
- `equal_radius` - Two circles with same radius

### Common Constraints
- `fixed` - Origin point anchored
- Plus all other standard constraints used across examples

## Purpose
This example ensures we exercise every constraint type available in the solver, particularly the less common ones that aren't naturally used in mechanical examples.

## Available Constraint Types
1. coincident
2. distance
3. angle
4. perpendicular
5. parallel
6. horizontal
7. vertical
8. equal_length
9. equal_radius
10. tangent
11. point_on_line
12. point_on_circle
13. fixed
